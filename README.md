## GZDoom for macOS

GZDoom is a source port of classic Doom (Ultimate Doom, Doom II, Final Doom), Heretic, Hexen, Strife and other games on Doom engine made by Graf Zahl. It is based on ZDoom by Randy Heit but has OpenGL renderer and many extended features.

**NOTE:** Most of changes were integrated back into the ZDoom/GZDoom Git repository. The purpose of this project is to improve macOS support, particularly with the native Cocoa version. Binary builds will be also provided from time to time.
